# UT-Weekly-Challenge-1
This is a UT Bootcamp Weekly Challenge #1. This week is an odd-numbered week, so your Challenge is an on-the-job ticket, 
which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility
The purpose of this project is accessibility begin with starter code that you need to modify. 
One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it 
(recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. 
In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
